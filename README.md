 ```bash
 python --version
 ```
 * Make sure it shows Python 3.12 or higher. 

(2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional)

This step is optional but recommended as it keeps yours projects dependencies isolated from other Python projects.

* Create a virtual environment:
 * Navigate to your project directory in the terminal
 * Run the following command:
 ```bash
 python -m venv venv
 ```
 This creates a virtual environment named `venv`

* activate the virtual environment:
 * On windows:
 ```bash
 venv\Scripts\activate
 ```
 
 * on MacOS/Linux:
 ```bash
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```
Once activated your terminal prompt will chjange to show the virtual environment is active)



3. Install required Python Packages
 2.1 Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install Flask and requests:

 ```bash
 pip install Flask
 pip install requests
 ```


4. Configure API keys:

* Create a file named `config.py` in the project directory where Cineblend is located. `config.py` should be in the same directory as `app.py` 
* Open `config.py` in a text editor and add the following lines replacing `"your_key_here"` with your actual API keys. 

```bash
OMDB_API_KEY = "your_omdb_api_key_here"
GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY = "your_google_books_api_key_here"
```

5. Running CineBlend
* In the terminal, navigate to the directory where CineBlend is located
